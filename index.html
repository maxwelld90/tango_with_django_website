                        <h2 id="intro">Introducing Tango with Django</h2>
                        <p><em>Tango with Django</em> is a beginner's guide to web development using the popular <em><a href="#">Python</a></em>-based web application framework, <em><a href="#">Django</a></em>. The complete book provides a hands-on guide to designing and building web applications, explaining in plain English how all the different <a href="#technologies">technologies</a> you will encounter fit together. All major processes are provided as a series of generalisable workflows to get you into the mindset of using Django quickly, reducing the learning curve, and advocating best practices when developing your web applications.</p>
                        <p>While teaching you the basics of Django, we will also guide you through the implementation of a simple web application, <a href="#">Rango</a> &mdash; providing a directory of different categories and links. By the end of the book, you will have fully implemented the application, as well as having deployed it online with the Python application hosting service, <em><a href="#">PythonAnywhere</a></em> &mdash; ready for the whole world to see your efforts!</p>

                                <h3>Setup Smart</h3>
                                <span>Setting up your Python development environment is an important part of any project. We show you how to set up your environment and project so that you can deploy your application in next to no time.</span>

                                <h3>Learn Fast</h3>
                                <span>This book has been designed to get you going fast and to learn by example. You'll learn the key aspects of the Python Django framework by developing a simple web application called Rango.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <h3>Code Simple</h3>
                                <span>To get you working with the Python Django Framework &mdash; and not against it &mdash; we have provided a series of different workflows to help you fall into line with the Model-View-Template architecture.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Since our initial draft release in October 2013, Tango with Django has been accessed over 2,000,000 times. Over 6,000 individuals have purchased their own copy of the later editions released on Leanpub since late 2016. The book has been used of the basis of web development courses all around the world, such as in educational institutions in India and Vietnam.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thousands of students at the University of Glasgow have used the book since 2014 &mdash; both undergraduate and postgraduate &mdash; to learn the basics of web development as part of the School of Computing Science's curriculum. Indeed, the authors were both employed by the University to teach web development until 2019!</p>

                        <p>What has made the book a success amongst the student population? How will it help you learn?</p>

                                <h3>Save yourself Time</h3>
                                <span>On many occasions we've seen clever students get stuck, spending hours trying to fight with Django and other aspect of web development &mdash; usually because a key piece of information was not provided, or something was not clear. While the occasional blip might set you back 10-15 minutes, sometimes issues can take hours to resolve. We‚Äôve tried to remove as many of these hurdles as possible. This will mean you can get on with developing your application, and not figuring out another piece of the puzzle.</span>

                                <h3>Improve your Workflow</h3>
                                <span>Using web application frameworks requires you to pick up and run with a particular design pattern, so you only have to fill in certain pieces in certain places. After working with many students, we heard lots of complaints about using web application frameworks, about how they take control away from them. To help you, we've created a number of workflows to focus your development process so that you can regain that sense of control and build your web application in a disciplined manner.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span>We are always looking for ways to improve this resource. We have open-sourced the book and corresponding Python implementation. We want to hear from you if you have any suggestions, improvements, or just want to contribute to the project! We always listen to reader feedback &mdash; a recent reader-suggested improvement has been the inclusion of tests for readers to compare their implementations against, so they know they are on track.</span>

                                <h3>Lower your Learning Curve</h3>
                                <span>Web application frameworks can save you a lot of hassle and lot of time. Well, that is only true if you know how to use them! Often the learning curve is steep. This book tries to get you going, and going fast. By showing you how to put together a web application with all the bells and whistles from the onset, the book shortens your learning curve. You'll be satisfied with your progress, even early on.</span>

                        <h2 id="technologies">Technologies Covered</h2>
                        <p><strong>Students often say they hate web development for the simple fact that there's so many damn technologies that they need to get up to speed with quickly. It often seems overwhelming to beginners.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>While we can't avoid you from having to learn all of the key web technologies, we have gone to considerable efforts to make Tango with Django a one-stop-shop for beginners &mdash; from introducing you to the basics of server-side programming (with Django and Python), to client-side presentation (<em>CSS</em>) and scripting (<em>JavaScript</em>). We employ different frameworks where possible to make the introduction to these different technologies easier.</p>

                        <ul class="grid three technologies">
                            <li class="python">

                                <h3>Python 3</h3>
                                <span>We make use of Python 3, making use of functions, classes and data structures like dictionaries. All of these essential concepts allow us to drive the Django framework.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="django">

                                <h3>The Django Framework</h3>
                                <span>Django is the core technology covered in this book. Closely following the Model-View-Template architecture, we discuss key concepts such as views (both functional and class-based), data-driven page generation, user authentication, form handling, page templating and a <em>whole lot more. There's a lot in the book &mdash; it's over 400 pages long!</em></span>
                            </li>

                                <h3>HTML5</h3>
                                <span>Following on from templating, we provide instructions on how to create standards-compliant HTML5 templates that your Rango app will use.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="apis">

                                <h3>External APIs</h3>
                                <span>We show you how to connect your Django project up to an external API, providing some additional service. Our tutorial focuses on the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/bing-web-search-api/" target="_blank">Microsoft Bing Search API.</a></span>

                                <h3>CSS &amp; JavaScript</h3>
                                <span>With the server-side covered by Python and Django, the book introduces you to two key technologies used on the client-side &mdash; CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for scripting). We use the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework</a> to give your application a good look quickly, and the <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery framework</a> to make client-side scripting a much more straightforward affair. We also introduce you to the basics of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp" target="_blank">AJAX</a>, allowing for the development asynchronous web applications.</span>
                            </li>

                                <h3>Git Version Control</h3>
                                <span>A crucial part of software development is being able to work efficiently in a team. From the start, we encourage you to use <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control" target="_blank">Git version control</a> system, so you will <var>commit</var> and <var>push</var> regularly!

                                <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
                                <span>We encourage you to consider test-driven development, and provide you with a series of unit tests that examine the functionality of your implementation.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="deploying">

                                <span>Our final key technology covered is how to <em>deploy your finished implementation to a web hosting service.</em> Moving from your device to the web, we choose <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a> for ease of use, showing you how to <var>clone</var> your project and set up the webserver for your finished application.</span>
