# The Tango with Django Website
This repository houses code for the redesigned [Tango with Django website](https://www.tangowithdjango.com). The old website was looking a little tired, and for the last major update of the Summer 2019 revisions, I've decided to design and implement a brand new, static webpage showcasing [our](https://www.github.com/leifos/) book, available for purchase on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/tangowithdjango2/).

My idea was simple: make use of the fantastic graphics we've developed for the front cover over the years to design a unique, awesome-looking website that makes use of all of the screen real estate. I think that I have succeeded in doing so, and have developed a webpage that scales over big screens to small (mobile devices and tablets). I love it; I hope you do, too!

Oh, and if you're a student using Tango with Django and are wondering why we don't teach you how to make websites like this in the book that is a fair enough question. It takes years of experience to be able to make webpages like this; the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) we use in the book helps get you so far, but the added polish is down to experience, being able to Google the right questions when I wasn't sure what was going on, and an awful lot of patience.

**Assumption:** expects you to use a modern browser, which to be honest, is a fair enough assumption nowadays. No support for Internet Explorer here.

**How did you do that, David?** Ask me! [Raise an issue](https://www.github.com/maxwelld90/tango_with_django_website/issues/) and I'll try an explain how something was achieved.
